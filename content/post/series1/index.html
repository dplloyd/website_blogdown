<p>This website was built using the excellent guidance written by <a href="http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/insights-from-the-markdown-whisperer/">Jeni Richmond</a>, which is based on a workshop delivered by <a href="https://github.com/apreshill">Alison Hill</a>. I stumbled across her instructions while trying to solve an if_else() issue in R - her website also provided a solution to that issue, too! The website itself is based on <a href="https://github.com/apreshill">Alison Hillâ€™s</a> work</p>
