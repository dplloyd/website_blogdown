I'm a civil service statistician, which broadly means I work in the collection, production and communication of official statistics.  Before that, I was a researcher at the University of Edinburgh, where I used microscopy to study how bacteria self assembled both on the surface and within the bulk of soft agar. And before that, I studied physics. Everyone has a past.
