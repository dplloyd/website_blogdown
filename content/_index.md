Welcome to my website, where I attempt to document little bits of R-related learning, data visualisation and perhaps some blogging. While I have a relatively technical background, the extent of my programming didn't extend much beyond what was required for the task at hand. Recently, I started using R more often in my day job, and somewhat to my surprise, discovered I enjoyed it very much. So, I am essentially using this website as motivation to continuing to learn R and document any hobby analyses or interesting features I stumble across the Internet. 

If you're interested, the code for generating the figure above is [here](/note/2021/01/01/waffle-life/).
