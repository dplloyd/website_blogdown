title: 'Building this website'
---

This website was built using the excellent guidance written by [Jeni Richmond](http://jenrichmond.rbind.io/post/insights-from-the-markdown-whisperer/), which is based on a workshop delivered by [Alison Hill](https://github.com/apreshill). I stumbled across her instructions while trying to solve an if_else() issue in R - her website also provided a solution to that issue, too! The website itself is based on [Alison Hill's](https://github.com/apreshill) work
