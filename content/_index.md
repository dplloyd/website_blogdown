Welcome to my website, where I attempt to document little bits of R-related learning, data visualisation and perhaps some blogging. If you're interested, the code for generating the figure above is [here](/note/2021/01/01/waffle-life/). The website template is [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org/)'s [Hugo Ivy](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-ivy) theme.

All pages are listed below. However, you can also visit the list page of a single section, e.g., [posts](/post/), or [notes](/note/).
